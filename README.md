# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

### Project Overview
The Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a comprehensive, console-based Java SE application that streamlines the management of students, courses, enrollments, grades, and academic records for educational institutes. This system provides complete functionality for managing students, courses, enrollments, grades, and academic records with robust file operations and data persistence capabilities.

## Key Features
* **Student Management**: Create, update, and manage student profiles and enrollment status.
* **Course Management**: Handle course creation, updates, and instructor assignments.
* **Enrollment System**: Manage student course enrollments with business rule validation.
* **Grading & Transcripts**: Record grades, calculate GPA, and generate academic transcripts.
* **File Operations**: Import/export data via CSV files with backup and archival capabilities.
* **Reporting**: Generate various academic reports using modern Java Stream API.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
* **JDK Version**: Java 11 or higher
* **IDE**: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (recommended)
* **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (installation guide provided)

### Running the Application
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd CCRM
    ```
2.  **Compile the project**:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/edu/ccrm/**/*.java
    ```
3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.Main
    ```
4.  **Enable Assertions** (recommended for testing):
    ```bash
    java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.Main
    ```

### Java Editions Comparison
| Feature | Java ME (Micro Edition) | Java SE (Standard Edition) | Java EE (Enterprise Edition) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Target Platform** | Mobile devices, embedded systems | Desktop applications, servers | Enterprise web applications |
| **Application Types** | Mobile apps, IoT devices | Standalone applications, applets | Web services, enterprise apps |
| **Core APIs** | Limited subset of Java APIs | Complete Java API set | Java SE + additional enterprise APIs |
| **Memory Footprint** | Minimal (KBs to few MBs) | Moderate (10s to 100s of MBs) | Large (100s of MBs to GBs) |
| **Key Technologies** | CLDC, MIDP, CDC | Swing, AWT, NIO, Collections | Servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA, CDI |
| **Examples** | Feature phones, smart cards | NetBeans, Eclipse, desktop tools | Banking systems, e-commerce |
| **Current Status** | Legacy (replaced by Android) | Active development | Transferred to Eclipse Foundation |

### Java Architecture: JDK, JRE, JVM
* **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: The runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It provides platform independence, automatic garbage collection, and a secure environment.
* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Contains everything needed to run Java applications, including the JVM and core libraries.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The complete development environment, which includes the JRE and all the development tools like the compiler (`javac`) and debugger (`jdb`).
